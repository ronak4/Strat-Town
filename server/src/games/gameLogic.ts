 *    present
 *  - `maxPlayers`: the game allows at most this many players (null to allow
 *    any number)
 *  - `start`: given the list of players, create a game state
 *  - `update`: updates the game state given a move by a player, or returns
 *    null if the move was not valid
 *  - `isDone`: checks if a state represents a completed game
 *  - `viewAs`: creates the view of a game's state for a given player (-1 for
 *    watchers)
 *  - `tagView`: adds the correct game key to the game view
